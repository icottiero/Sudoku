# Sudoku
 Simple game of Sudoku written in multiple languages.

The goal of this project is to go on a voyage through different languages and technologies by using them to implement a game of Sudoku. This task was picked because it was complex enough for me to have a chance to get familiar with the platform I'm using, but simple enough to be implementable in a couple of evenings.

The code here might not (and probably will not) always be written in the best way. If you see something obvious that I've missed or some place where the technology is misused, feel free to point it out! My goal is not to have perfect code from the beginning, but to try using it and learn about it along the way.
